You were a regular 16 year old student studying for the school day. 
One night a tear in reality forced you out of your dimension and in to a multiverse of chaos! 
Now bouncing from one world to the next you must survive the myriad of dangers that lurk at every corner.

Your mission:
Survive, so you can get home. The question is how?
A) Take the routes with less people, and try to avoid the natural dangers of your new environment!
Or,
B) Take the routes where people are, and avoid the man/alien made dangers!

Hopefully with courage, vigilance and some luck, you can return home in one piece - or not?
