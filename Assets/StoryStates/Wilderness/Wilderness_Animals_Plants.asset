  storyText: 'Oh no that wasn''t a good idea. The animals caught a whiff of your
    scent and are now chasing you!


    A. Leg it to the portal and hope to all
    hope you make it!

    Or...

    B. Hide in the bushes - surely after a time
    those hungry creatures will stop the chase and go back to sleep?'
