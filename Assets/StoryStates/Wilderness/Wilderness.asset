  storyText: 'So you chose going into the wilderness?


    Ok, well besides the
    initial obstacles you had to avoid to get here, you need to decide what routes
    you will go...


    A. Go through the forest and bushes past the weird flora,
    and then sneak past the deadly animals? Who doesn''t want to smell flowers before
    their untimely demise?


    Or...


    B. Sneak by those deadly animals first,
    then go through the forest to the clearing. Can''t be that hard right?'
