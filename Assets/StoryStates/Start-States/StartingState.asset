  storyText: "You were a regular 16 year old student studying for the school day.
    \r\nOne night a tear in reality forced you out of your dimension and in to a
    multiverse of chaos! \r\nNow bouncing from one world to the next you must survive
    the myriad of dangers that lurk at every corner.\r\n\r\nYour mission:\r\nSurvive,
    so you can get home. The question is how?\r\nA) Take the routes with less people,
    and try to avoid the natural dangers of your new environment!\r\nOr,\r\nB) Take
    the routes where people are, and avoid the man/alien made dangers!\r\n\r\nHopefully
    with courage, vigilance and some luck, you can return home in one piece - or
    not?"
